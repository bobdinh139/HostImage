## No parents

+ genetic diversity is largely based on mutation and mitosis, so there is no diversity, no population, no crossover, just an individual undergoes microevolution.

+ In simple term, No diversity generally means dumber individual (except for extraordinarily smart individual); mutation could be both bad and good; it is uncertain that the next gen is better than the prev gen, but ultimately, there is gonna be one gen best fit to the environment as a result of natural selection. (Random at its finest)

+ The first gen learn from the prev gen how to jump correctly, so if first gen is dumb, so is the second gen. Mutation occurs in the best trait (individual who goes furthest)

+ What happens if there are more than one? More individuals with unique traits. Crossover happens; they produce offsprings which carry both their parents traits. Mutation still happens but at a larger scale. Therefore, individuals are generally smarter and more diverse. Moreover, the population will be more stable. In general, study faster, smarter and need less generation. Catch? It is harder to write, needs more inputs. I have been doing research and unable to write this on time.

+ I am no expert in biology btw

## With parents

+ After several runs, the the balls know how to survive at around 3-4 gen, which is significantly better than the first program (which could takes 1 to 200+ trails) since there are more individuals in a population. Again, mutation is unpredictable.

+ [fun-fact] the balls share their parents' looks (average the color of the dad with the mom's).
