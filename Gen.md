### Mutation-dependant

The program includes a mutation-dependent feature where the survival of a species is predominantly influenced by mutation and mitosis. Each individual undergoes microevolution through an infinite series of mutations, aiming to reach the perfect gene. However, this process lacks genetic diversity, resulting in individuals with generally lower intelligence. Mutations can have both negative and positive effects, making it uncertain whether the next generation will surpass the previous one. Nevertheless, over time, a generation best suited to the environment will emerge, thanks to the workings of natural selection. The program's purpose is to enable the next generation to learn from its predecessors. Mutations will occur in the best-performing trait found in the individual that has progressed the furthest

### Crossover-driven

What happens when there are multiple individuals with unique traits? Crossover occurs, resulting in offspring that inherit traits from both parents. Mutation continues to happen but on a larger scale. As a result, individuals are generally smarter and more diverse, leading to a more stable population. They are able to learn faster, exhibit greater intelligence, and require fewer generations to adapt.

Observing the simulation, after several runs, the balls (referring to the simulated entities) demonstrate survival skills within approximately 3-4 generations, which is significantly faster than the first program (which could take anywhere between 1-200 runs due to the unpredictable nature of mutation). The balls exhibit a combination of their parents' appearances, with the color being averaged between the dad and mom. While I didn't fully grasp neural networks, I was determined to complete what I had started. Motivated by this desire, I began coding from scratch and completed the task within less than 24 hours. The lesson learned here is to not overlook the basics, as they form the foundation for more advanced concepts.

Genetic variation is incredibly crucial. It serves as the primary catalyst for a stable environment and growth. Let us strive to conserve species and protect the environment. We are currently facing the sixth mass extinction, and this time, humanity itself is the meteor.

This program is written in Java and features a simple neural network. Currently, the program accepts only one input, determining whether to jump or not. However, in the near future, the brains will be designed to handle additional inputs, potentially up to three.
